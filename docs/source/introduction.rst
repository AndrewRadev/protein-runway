Introduction
============

Protein Runway is designed to visualize the essential dynamics for trajectories of large molucules, such as proteins. It focuses on identifying key structural movements using normal mode analysis.

Key Features:

- Visualize molecular trajectories.
- Extract key movement patterns.
- Integrate with tools like `Chainsaw`, `Merizo`, `bio3D`.
